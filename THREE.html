<h1>GREENLAND SHARKS</h1>

<p>
Greenland sharks may live 250–400 years — and it changes how their mind works.

Greenland sharks grow and age so slowly that their brains develop over centuries.
Psychology implication: their perception of time, learning, and stress is radically different from fast-lived animals.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very slow emotional reactivity</li>
  <li>Minimal stress response</li>
  <li>Long-term memory without urgency</li>
</ul>

<h1>AXOLOTLS</h1>

<p>
Axolotls don’t just regenerate limbs — they may not experience trauma the same way.

Axolotls can regenerate brain tissue, spinal cord, and even parts of the heart without forming scar tissue.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimal long-term fear conditioning</li>
  <li>No permanent trauma encoding</li>
  <li>Nervous system biased toward reset rather than rumination</li>
</ul>

<p>
This makes them a major model organism for studying PTSD prevention, neural plasticity, and memory rewriting.
